# AI Logica - Requirements Specification

## 1. Core Functional Requirements

Based on the application outline, AI Logica shall provide the following capabilities:

### 1.1 Graphical Gate Layout
- **FR-1**: The end user will be able to graphically layout logic gates on a drawing area
- **FR-2**: It will be easy for the end user to select which gates to place onto the drawing area

### 1.2 Gate Wiring
- **FR-3**: The end user will be able to wire the inputs and outputs of the gates together

### 1.3 Simulation Capabilities
- **FR-4**: The application will be able to simulate the behavior of the connected logic gates
- **FR-5**: The end user will be able to step through updates incrementally

### 1.4 Hierarchical Design
- **FR-6**: The end user will be able to save their layouts so that they can be used as a black box component in another layout
- **FR-7**: The end user will be able to drill down into black box component so that they can see inside it
- **FR-8**: The end user will be able to drill up from a black box component so that they can see how it is being used

### 1.5 Design Overview
- **FR-9**: The end user should be able to see an overview of their design from the most abstract level down to the most primitive logic gates

## 2. Technical Requirements

### 2.1 Platform
- Web-based application using Blazor Server and .NET 8
- Browser compatibility for modern desktop browsers
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

### 2.2 Performance
- Real-time simulation updates
- Smooth user interactions for gate placement and wiring
- Efficient rendering of complex circuit layouts

### 2.3 Usability
- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Clear visual feedback for all operations
- Minimal learning curve for new users

## 3. Conflicting Requirements and Trade-offs

As requested in the documentation requirements, the following conflicting requirements must be highlighted for appropriate direction:

### 3.1 Simplicity vs. Power
**Conflict**: Easy gate selection and placement vs. comprehensive gate library
- **Trade-off**: Start with basic gates (AND, OR, NOT) and expand based on user needs
- **Decision**: Focus on the most primitive gates. When more complex gates are wanted they will be explicitly requested

### 3.2 Visual Feedback vs. Performance
**Conflict**: Rich visual simulation feedback vs. real-time performance
- **Trade-off**: Optimize rendering for small circuits, provide performance warnings for large ones
- **Decision**: Focus on visual simulation feedback, keep on top of developing performance issues as additional features are added

### 3.3 Educational Focus vs. Professional Use
**Conflict**: Simple learning interface vs. advanced design capabilities
- **Trade-off**: Progressive interface complexity based on user experience level
- **Decision**: Prefer a simple interface, if more advanced use is required it will be asked for explicitly

### 3.4 Cross-Platform vs. Feature Richness
**Conflict**: Browser compatibility vs. advanced interactive features
- **Trade-off**: Use standard web technologies with graceful feature degradation
- **Decision**: Prefer browser compatibility, however if there is a significant opportunity to gain performance then request a decision
