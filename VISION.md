# AI Logica - Application Vision

## Vision Statement

AI Logica is an exploration of using an AI agent to develop a logic gate simulator. The application aims to provide users with the ability to graphically design and simulate digital logic circuits through an interactive web interface.

## Core Mission

To create a functional logic gate simulator that demonstrates:
- **Visual Design**: Graphical layout of logic gates on a drawing area
- **Interactive Selection**: Easy gate selection and placement
- **Circuit Wiring**: Ability to wire inputs and outputs together
- **Simulation**: Behavior simulation of connected logic gates
- **Hierarchical Design**: Component abstraction and drill-down capabilities

## Application Outline

The envisioned application will provide the following core capabilities:

### 1. Gate Layout and Selection
- Users can graphically layout logic gates on a drawing area
- Easy selection and placement of gates from a palette or menu
- Visual representation of gates with clear input/output points

### 2. Wiring and Connections
- Users can wire the inputs and outputs of gates together
- Visual feedback for wire connections
- Clear indication of signal flow

### 3. Simulation Engine
- The application can simulate the behavior of connected logic gates
- Real-time calculation and propagation of logic states
- Visual indication of signal states on wires and gates

### 4. Step-by-Step Execution
- Users can step through simulation updates incrementally
- Control over simulation timing and progression
- Clear visualization of state changes

### 5. Hierarchical Design
- Users can save their layouts as reusable black box components
- Ability to drill down into black box components to see internal structure
- Ability to drill up from components to see usage context
- Overview of design hierarchy from abstract to primitive gates
