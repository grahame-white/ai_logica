        ## For AI Developers addressing development-related questions:
        
        ### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SETUP STEPS:
        1. **CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Run `script/setup-git-hooks` to install git hooks before any development work
        2. **Complete setup**: Run `script/setup` to install dependencies and verify environment
        3. **Review documentation**: Read REQUIREMENTS.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md
        
        ### üéØ QUESTION RESPONSE WORKFLOW:
        4. **Understand the context**: Analyze the question to identify what guidance or code changes are needed
        5. **Provide clear guidance**: Use clear, accurate information from official documentation
        6. **Test recommendations**: If suggesting code changes or procedures, test them first
        7. **Update documentation**: If the question reveals documentation gaps, consider updating relevant docs
        8. **Follow standards**: Ensure any code suggestions follow project coding standards
        
        ### üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT SCRIPTS FOR TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
        - `script/setup` - Complete setup for development
        - `script/server` - Start development server for testing
        - `script/test` - Run all tests
        - `script/format` - Format code
        - `script/check-git-hooks` - Verify git hooks are installed
        - `script/cibuild` - Run CI checks locally
        
        ### ü§ù RESPONSE GUIDELINES FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS:
        - Provide clear, helpful answers
        - Reference official documentation when possible
        - If suggesting code changes, ensure they follow project standards
        - Consider if the question indicates missing documentation
        
        ### üîß FOR DEVELOPERS ADDRESSING QUESTIONS:
        - Check if the question reveals gaps in documentation
        - Consider if frequently asked questions need better documentation
        - Use questions to improve the user experience
        - Update documentation if the question is common
