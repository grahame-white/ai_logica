        ## For AI Developers implementing this feature:
        
        ### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SETUP STEPS:
        1. **CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Run `script/setup-git-hooks` to install git hooks before any development work
        2. **Complete setup**: Run `script/setup` to install dependencies and verify environment  
        3. **Review documentation**: Read REQUIREMENTS.md, DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md
        
        ### üìã IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW:
        4. **Analyze requirements**: Review the functional requirements above, assign appropriate FR-X.Y IDs, and identify any conflicts with existing requirements that need resolution
        5. **Understand testing**: Review E2E_TESTING_STRATEGY.md for testing approach
        6. **Follow the pattern**: Use existing code as examples for implementation patterns
        7. **Update requirements**: Add new functional requirements to REQUIREMENTS.md with proper IDs
        8. **Test thoroughly**: Run `script/test` frequently during development
        9. **Format code**: Use `script/format` before committing
        10. **Verify in development**: Test feature works using `script/server`
        
        ### üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT SCRIPTS:
        - `script/setup` - Complete setup for development
        - `script/setup-git-hooks` - Install git hooks (CRITICAL first step)
        - `script/server` - Start development server
        - `script/test` - Run all tests
        - `script/format` - Format code
        - `script/check-git-hooks` - Verify git hooks are installed
        - `script/cibuild` - Run CI checks locally
